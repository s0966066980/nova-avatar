- License: verify the exact FunASR release and model license before redistribution

## RAGFlow and dedicated embedding service

RAGFlow and model images are fetched on the host, not bundled in the Nova

the Nova Apache-2.0 license does not relicense them.
The accompanying Elasticsearch, MySQL, MinIO-compatible, and Valkey images
also retain their respective upstream license and distribution terms.

## ER-NeRF, TalkingGaussian, and UltraLight

- Role: optional avatar engines and related rendering components

terms remain controlling for those files.

## Optional TTS backends

Edge TTS, GPT-SoVITS, CosyVoice, Fun-CosyVoice, Fish TTS, XTTS, and IndexTTS2
are optional integrations. Verify the exact code, service, voice, model, and
checkpoint terms before redistribution or commercial packaging.

## Models, weights, and datasets

Model weights and datasets are not relicensed by Nova Avatar. A usable code
license does not imply that associated weights, training data, voices, or
generated assets have the same permissions. Distributors are responsible for
reviewing the exact artifacts they ship.
